        <h2>Community</h2>

        <p><b>A great way to help out your community is to grow more than you need in your personal garden.  You can also get involved with programs such as the Green Village Initiative!</b></p>
        
            <p>Community Gardens 
                Green Village Initiative works with 12 Community Gardens that nourish the Bridgeport community. More than 100 gardeners grow pesticide-free, fresh vegetables for their families’ tables, and our gardens are a primary source of fresh food in many neighborhoods.  We support Bridgeport gardeners by providing hands-on workshops, growing guides and crop plans, seeds and seedlings, soil, and other resources.
                
                Thank you for a wonderful season! Applications for community garden plots have now closed. We will be updating our website with more information on each community garden this winter 2022/2023! The online application for the 2023 growing season will go live January 31, 2023. We look forward to growing with you soon!
